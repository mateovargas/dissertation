The year is 2240. After the discovery of faster than light travel, humanity has begun colonizing the stars.
The colony ship, UNSS Hadley's Hope, has been traveling to Kepler-452B, designated Horizon. Now in orbit, the 
shipâ€™s first landing party has returned to discuss their preliminary findings. Despite all precautions and 
decontamination procedures, the landing party brought something back with them.
You are the Chief Medical Officer of the UNSS Hadley's Hope. You are tasked with guiding the ship through the
outbreak with as best you can with the resources at hand. Good luck!
Hello, I am Medical Unit 1138. I am here to assist you in implementing your required instructions. 
The shiponly has limited resources, I'm afraid, and every crew member that is not in hypersleep is 
vital to the functioning of the colony. 
Quarantining individuals uses the less energy than vaccination but prevents crew members from accomplishing 
their duties and can be used immediately. 
Alternatively, vaccination allows crew members to continue preparing for the colony's landfall, 
but consumes more energy to implement, as well as taking time to create. 
It is up to you to manage these resources as you see fit while guiding the colony to the end of the infection. 
Once the infection spread is over, we can initiate landfall.
Luckily, it seems that this disease is non-lethal, however, we would not want to expose the colonists to undue risks. 
Each day of the infection, we will speak and you may see me and give me new instructions.
Did you understand all that?
